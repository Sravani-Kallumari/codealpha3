# Basic Chatbot

A simple, text-based chatbot that can have conversations with users. This chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input in a conversational manner. It leverages popular Python libraries like [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to process and analyze the text, allowing for basic conversational capabilities.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Engage in text-based conversations with the bot.
- **Basic NLP**: Understand user input using simple Natural Language Processing techniques like tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Predefined Responses**: Set up a list of predefined responses for common user inputs.
- **Contextual Responses**: The bot can handle basic context (i.e., remembering previous questions or statements).
- **User Input Processing**: Uses NLTK or spaCy to process user input and generate appropriate responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** 
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **spaCy** (for more advanced NLP tasks)
- **Regular Expressions** (for pattern matching)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or higher
- Install NLTK and spaCy
  - To install NLTK:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```
  - To install spaCy:
    ```bash
    pip install spacy
    ```

- Download the spaCy language model (for example, `en_core_web_sm`):
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

### Installation



1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download necessary data for NLTK:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')  # For tokenization
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')  # For POS tagging
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

## How It Works

The chatbot processes user input using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here's a basic workflow:

1. **User Input**: The chatbot receives text input from the user.
2. **Tokenization**: The input is broken down into smaller units (tokens) using the `nltk.word_tokenize()` or spaCy's tokenizer.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The bot can identify names, locations, dates, etc., using spaCy’s NER feature.
4. **Response Generation**: Based on keyword matching, predefined rules, or a simple NLP model, the bot generates an appropriate response.
5. **Bot Output**: The chatbot then responds to the user with a predefined or generated reply.

## Example

- **User**: "Hello"
- **Bot**: "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
  
- **User**: "What is your name?"
- **Bot**: "I'm a chatbot created to assist you. What would you like to talk about?"

## Usage

1. **Start a Conversation**: Simply run the script and start typing your questions or statements.
   
2. **Example Chat**:
   ```
   Hello, chatbot!
   Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

   What's your name?
   Bot: I'm a chatbot created to assist you. What would you like to talk about?
   
   Tell me a joke.
   Bot: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!
   ```

## Customization

- **Predefined Responses**: You can add more responses or keywords to improve the bot’s conversational flow.
- **Extend NLP Features**: Integrate more complex NLP techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
- **Add Memory**: Implement memory functionality to allow the bot to remember user inputs across sessions.
